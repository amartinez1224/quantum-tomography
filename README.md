# quantum-tomography
This repository conatins a program to perform quantum tomography over marginal quadrature distributions and obtain Wigner functions. It also allows to calculate the density matrix in the quadrature and number representation using the Wigner function. Includes samples of simulated marginal distributions for the vacuum, coherent, squeezed and thermal states. A friendly GUI is also included.
